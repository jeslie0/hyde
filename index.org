* About
I am a PhD student at the [[https://www.uwo.ca][University of Western Ontario]] with [[https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/][Chris Kapulkin]] as my supervisor. I graduated with an integrated masters at the [[https://www.ed.ac.uk/][University of Edinburgh]] in July 2018 (supervised by [[https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/antony-maciocia][Antony Maciocia]]) and started my PhD in September 2019. My areas of research include homotopy type theory and higher category theory. I am generally interested in foundations of mathematics and their relations to category theory.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy [[/images/home/running.jpg">][running]], [[/images/home/cycling.jpg][cycling]] and swimming.
* Office hours and current tutoring work
