title: Higher category theory - Basic notions

<p>
Since my last post, I have moved from Scotland to Canada to start a PhD at The University of Western Ontario. The course started on September first, so I have been here just over a month. The main subject I am taking is higher category theory, taught by my supervisor Chris Kalpulkin. In an effort to cement my understanding on the subject, I will be writing occasional blog posts on what we cover and my thoughts.

The main text being used is Cisinski's <a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-regensburg.de/cisinski/CatLR.pdf">Higher Categories and Homotopical Algebra</a>. Another source I might refer to is Rezk's <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rezk/quasicats.pdf">Stuff About Quasi Categories</a>. Without further ado, let us dive in!

Before we get into higher categories, we should go the very basics of the notion of category that we are familiar with. Recall that a category \(\mathscr{A}\) is a collection of things we call objects and between any two objects \(A\), \(B\), there is a collection of things we call morphisms or maps, which we shall denote \(\mathscr{A}(A,B)\). For any object \(A\) there is a specified map \(1_A \in \mathscr{A}(A,A)\) and there is an associative function, called composition \(-\circ -: \mathscr{A}(A,B) \times \mathscr{A}(B,C) \rightarrow \mathscr{A}(A,C)\), which satisfies \(f \circ 1_A = f\) and \(1_B \circ f = f\), for \(f \in \mathscr{A}(A,B)\). A natural question arises: why stop here? We have defined maps between objects, so what's to stop us adding in maps between maps? Technically nothing is stopping us, however the categories that we know and love only have one level of map. A category that has two levels of maps is known as a 2-category. In a 2-category, we have objects, then morphisms between objects (call these 1-morphisms) then another type of morphism between 1-morphisms (call these 2-morphisms). We also start calling ordinary categories 1-categories. As you can probably guess, we think of an \(n\)-category as a category with \(n\) ``layers'' of maps. With this view point, what do you think a 0-category is? This framework allows us to define what an \(\infty\)-category should be: a higher category with no final level of maps; we can always have another level of map.

The prototypical example of a 1-category is \(\textbf{Set}\), the category of sets, whose objects are sets with morphisms being functions. The prototypical example of a 2-category is the category of 1-categories, with objects 1-categories, 1-morphisms being functors and 2-morphisms natural transformations. The 2-category \(\textbf{Cat}\) is what we call a strict 2-category. By this, we mean that the associativity of composition of the 1-morphisms is defined on the nose, that is \(F \circ (G \circ H) = (F \circ G) \circ H\). We can relax the notion to get a more fruitful theory by defining associativity up to isomorphism. For this to make sense, there are several coherence diagrams that are required to commute. This isn't really an issue, but it does make the definition of a weak 2-category a little unwieldy. The situation only gets worse when we consider what coherence diagrams a weak 3-category should satisfy and as we increase \(n\), the definition of an \(n\)-category becomes too complicated to actually use. What we want to find is a general definition of an \(n\)-category, or even better, and \(\infty\)-category, which is concise and usable. To do this, we shall use some of the tools from homotopy theory, which we shall discuss next time.

Let's look at an example of something that has the type of structure we have been discussing. Take your favourite 'nice' topological space \(X\), and consider paths \(p, q:I \rightarrow X\) with \(p(1) = q(0)\). We can then concatenate these two paths to get \(p * q\). Suppose now we have another path \(r\) with \(q(1) = r(0)\). We can then form two paths \((p * q) * r\) and \(p * (q * r)\), which are not equal as functions. If you recall how concatenation works, \(p*q\) has \(p\) and \(q\) traversed at double speed. When we consider \((p * q) * r\) and \(p * (q * r)\), we see that in the former, \(p\) and \(q\) are traversed at quadruple speed, with \(r\) at double, while in the latter, \(p\) is traversed at double speed while \(q\) and \(r\) go at quadruple speed. The two paths \((p * q) * r\) and \(p * (q * r)\) are however equal up to homotopy; they can be continuously morphed from one into the other. We can actually view a topological space as a higher category! The objects are the elements of the space, the 1-morphisms are paths from points \(x\) to \(y\), with composition given by concatenation. The above argument shows that associativity does not hold on the nose, but up to homotopy. We can add in 2-morphisms to be homotopies between paths. Homotopies, however, can be seen as a different type of path. To make concatenation work, we need to add in a homotopy between homotopies: a 3-morphism! It is clear that for every \(n\)-morphism, there should be an \(n+1\) morphism to make the associativity of concatenation hold weakly. This gives us an \(infty\)-category, known as the Fundamental Groupoid of a topological space. Assuming our space \(X\) is path connected, we see that every path is ``invertible'', we can just traverse the path from finish to start, and end up no having moved. This gives it the structure of a (weak) groupoid. If we expand now to the category of topological spaces \(\textbf{Top}\), this becomes an \((\infty, 1)\)-category. The notation \((n,k)\)-category tells us that any \(k+n\)-morphism or higher is invertible.

The above is a very informal way to think about what a higher category. In the next post, we shall start developing the tools to talk about them precisely. For more light reading, I suggest looking at John Baez's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9705009">An Introduction to n-Categories</a>, which gives a much broader overview into what higher categories are.
